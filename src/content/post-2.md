Yesterday marks my first day participating in the [GitHub 30 Day Challenge](https://medium.com/@docix/github-30-day-challenge-7eaac41e4176). Resolutions, challenges, there is often something missing for me, something that doesn't quite provide that "click". 

I am nearing the end of an intensive 20 week program, where my career path as a fullstack software developer begins. The program itself has been extremely challenging, as well as rewarding, and as everyone knows, life doesn't stop even though you'd appreciate the logistical convenience of it. 

Learning code and programming logic has been extremely signficant, but also has my own personal understanding of how I work. Over the years, it's been a very layered experience. A person keeps revisiting topics, viewing them from different angles, having many humbling moments. You get to learn to be uncomfortable, and to grow from it, rather than let it get you down.

This 30 day challenge has just enough flexibility to keep my interest. The motivation is absolutely there, joined with a sobering core- I can accomplish so much, but only if I take care of myself. I can accept and appreciate help, but only if I take care of myself. 

Meditation, structuring my learning for the next 30 days, practicing good habits as a developer, and writing about these experiences (either for myself or for others), these are all measurable, achievable, and beneficial. And they are all things I want to do, to better myself, as well as those around me.
